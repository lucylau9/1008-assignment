                    <p>AI has become an increasingly popular topic, and something us at Puzlr are interested in. Our recent project: "Our AI Future" explores the implications of AI on humanity in a way that's easy and fun for children to understanding. Currently we are working on implementing more ideas of AI and even making our own chatbot.</p>
